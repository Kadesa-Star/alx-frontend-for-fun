Accessibility Overview
Accessibility refers to designing and developing digital content in a way that enables all users, including those with disabilities, to navigate, understand, and interact with the content effectively. Accessibility improves user experience, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities, can access and benefit from digital content.

Key Principles of Accessibility (WCAG)
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are the standard guidelines for accessibility. They focus on four core principles, often summarized as POUR:

Perceivable: Information must be presented in ways that users can perceive, whether through sight, hearing, or other senses.
Operable: Users must be able to navigate and operate all interactive elements with different input methods, such as keyboards.
Understandable: Content should be easy to read and predictable, so users can comprehend and interact effectively.
Robust: Content should be compatible with current and future user tools, including assistive technologies like screen readers.
Accessibility Levels
WCAG includes three levels of conformance:

Level A: Basic accessibility features that are the minimum required.
Level AA: A mid-level standard that meets most accessibility requirements and is often legally required for many organizations.
Level AAA: The highest level, providing the best accessibility, though not all criteria are practical for every site.
Why Accessibility Matters
Accessibility helps make websites usable for people with various disabilities, such as visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. It also enhances the overall usability and quality of the web experience for all users.

Tools and Testing
Common tools and techniques for testing accessibility include:

Automated tools (like Axe or Lighthouse) for quick checks.
Screen readers for navigating content without sight (e.g., VoiceOver, NVDA).
Keyboard navigation testing to ensure functionality without a mouse.
By focusing on accessibility, developers create more inclusive digital spaces, improve SEO, and ensure compliance with regulations like the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) and Section 508 in the United States.
