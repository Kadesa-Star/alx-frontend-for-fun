Forms are essential elements in web development.
They allow users to input and submit data. 
They facilitate user interaction with a web application 
for actions such as registration, login, searches, and feedback.

HTML5 provides various form controls like text inputs, checkboxes, 
radio buttons, and more, to capture different types of user data. 
Using attributes such as required, pattern, and type enhances 
form validation and user experience.

Labels (<label>) improve accessibility by indicating which input 
the user should fill out, while pseudo-classes like :invalid and 
:valid allow styling based on validation states. 
Proper use of forms ensures usability, accessibility, 
and efficient data collection.
